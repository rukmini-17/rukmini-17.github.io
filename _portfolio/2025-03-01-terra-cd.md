### Description
* **Dataset Creation:** Created TERRA-CD, a **benchmark dataset** of **5,221 paired Sentinel-2 images** across 232 cities with multi-level annotations for Change Detection.
* **Model Development:** Applied **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** techniques to design and evaluate multiple models (Siamese networks, STANet variants, HRSCD strategies), achieving **93.2% accuracy** in semantic change detection.
* **Recognition:** Won **Best Technical Implementation** at College of Engineering Pune; research currently under review at a Q1 journal.
