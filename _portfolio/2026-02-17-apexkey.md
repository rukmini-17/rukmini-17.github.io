### Description
* **High-Performance RPC:** Engineered a distributed storage engine using **C++20** and **gRPC**, leveraging Protocol Buffers for efficient, low-latency cross-process communication.
* **Concurrency & Memory Safety:** Implemented a thread-safe architecture utilizing **std::mutex** and **RAII-style locking**, ensuring data integrity across concurrent client requests.
* **Durability Layer:** Designed and implemented a **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** strategy to persist in-memory state to disk, ensuring **100% data durability** across server restarts.
* **Benchmarking & Optimization:** Developed a custom benchmarking suite to validate system performance, achieving a throughput of **3,046 ops/sec** with an average latency of **0.328 ms** on ARM64 architecture.
* **Modern Systems Engineering:** Managed complex dependencies via **vcpkg** and optimized the build lifecycle with **CMake**, following industry-standard C++ software patterns.
