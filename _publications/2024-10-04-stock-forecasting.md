**Abstract:**
Prediction models are crucial in the stock market as they aid in forecasting future prices and trends. This paper presents a Bidirectional Multivariate LSTM model designed to predict short-term stock prices of Indian companies in the NIFTY 100. The proposed model, when applied to a dataset containing technical indicators like EMA and Bollinger Bands, achieved an exceptionally high average R2 score of 99.4779%.
