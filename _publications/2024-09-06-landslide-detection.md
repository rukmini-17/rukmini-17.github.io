**Abstract:**
Landslides inflict substantial societal and economic damage, underscoring their global significance as recurrent and destructive natural disasters. The purpose of this work is to investigate CNNs’ potential in more detail, with an emphasis on comparison of CNN based models for better landslide detection. We compared four traditional semantic segmentation models (U-Net, LinkNet, PSPNet, and FPN) utilizing a ResNet50 backbone. According to the experimental results, LinkNet gave the best results among the four models having an Accuracy of 97.49% and a F1-score of 85.7%.
