**Abstract:**
Landslides inflict substantial societal and economic damage. The purpose of this work is to investigate CNNs’ potential in more detail. We compared four traditional semantic segmentation models (U-Net, LinkNet, PSPNet, and FPN) utilizing a ResNet50 backbone. According to the experimental results, LinkNet gave the best results among the four models having an Accuracy of 97.49% and a F1-score of 85.7%.
