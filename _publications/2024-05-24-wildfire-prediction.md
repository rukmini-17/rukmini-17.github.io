**Abstract:**
This paper proposes a method of wildfire risk assessment of large land regions focusing on remote sensing satellite imagery. We implemented different CNN based classification models, namely VGG16, ResNet50, Xception and InceptionV3 as well as four VGG-16 based transfer learning models. Our proposed transfer learning model having a three layered pyramid structure yielded the best results, with an accuracy of 0.9650.
