**Abstract:**
Network intrusion detection is critical for securing modern networks. This study proposes a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) model featuring a residual block architecture with dilated convolutions. Evaluated on the Edge-IIoTset dataset, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 96.72% and a loss of 0.0688, outperforming ID CNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM models.

**Proposed TCN Architecture:**
