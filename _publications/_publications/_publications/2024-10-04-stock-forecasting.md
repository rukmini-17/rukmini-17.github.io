**Abstract:**
Prediction models are crucial in the stock market as they aid in forecasting future prices and trends, enabling investors to make informed decisions and manage risks more effectively. This paper presents a Bidirectional Multivariate LSTM model designed to predict short-term stock prices of Indian companies in the NIFTY 100. The proposed Bidirectional Multivariate LSTM model, when applied to a dataset containing technical indicators like EMA and Bollinger Bands, achieved an exceptionally high average R2 score of 99.4779% across four major stocks, significantly outperforming Unidirectional Multivariate LSTM models.
