I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the **University of Massachusetts Amherst**, focusing on **Machine Learning Systems** and **Scalable AI**.

My technical interests lie at the intersection of **Deep Learning** and **Efficiency**. I am actively exploring:
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Benchmarking the efficiency trade-offs of **Selective State Space Models (Mamba)** vs. Transformers (linear O(L) vs. quadratic O(L^2) scaling), and advancing **narrative understanding** through synthetic data generation and fine-tuning for word-sense disambiguation.
* **Computer Vision:** Leveraging deep learning for geospatial analysis and remote sensing (my background prior to UMass).
* **Network Systems:** Studying efficient algorithms and optimization techniques for modern distributed networks.

I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering at **College of Engineering Pune** in 2025.

I am currently seeking **Data Science and Machine Learning Internships** for Summer 2026. I am passionate about building AI solutions that are scalable and optimized for the real world.
